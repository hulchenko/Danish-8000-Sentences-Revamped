This deck is based on "â†’ Danish 8 000 sentences sorted from easiest to hardest" https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162908183
It is a modification of that deck, with the author's permission. Check out his deck page to see how he created the deck.

## Changes
 - 2 way cards. There are cards asking Danish -> English, as well as English -> Danish. This way the knowledge is not just one way.
 - Audio updated to Danish TTS via AwesomeTTS and GoogleAPI. The pronunciation is much better now.
    - This also reduces the deck size from 144MB to ~65MB
