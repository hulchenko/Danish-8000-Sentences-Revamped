This is a deck of 8,000 Sentences in Danish with translations and audio, ordered from easiest to hardest. Make sure to set "Show new cards in order added" in your deck options. It is great for a beginner in Danish, as the cards start easy and get harder as you go.

This deck is based on "â†’ Danish 8 000 sentences sorted from easiest to hardest" <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162908183" rel="nofollow">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162908183</a>
It is a modification of that deck, with the author's permission. Check out his deck page to see how he created the deck.

Changes:
 - 2 way cards. There are cards asking Danish -&gt; English, as well as English -&gt; Danish. This way the knowledge is not just one way.
 - Audio updated to Danish TTS via AwesomeTTS and GoogleAPI. The pronunciation is much better now.
    - This also reduces the deck size from 144MB to ~65MB


This deck is managed (very primitively for now) on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ll-in-anki/Danish-8000-Sentences-Revamped" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ll-in-anki/Danish-8000-Sentences-Revamped</a> I plan on implementing <a href="https://github.com/OnkelTem/anki-dm" rel="nofollow">Anki Deck Manager</a> in the future, so that all the sentences are simply stored in an excel sheet, to make it easier for others to suggest changes/fixes.
